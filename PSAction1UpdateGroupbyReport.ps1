# Name: PSAction1UpdateGroupbyReport.ps1
# Description: Script is designed to compare report endpoint information and update group based on what endpoints are found (or not found) in a report.  
# NOTE BEFORE RUNNING:  You will need to create a report in "Simple Report" in Action1 via Custom Reports that has Endpoint names as the primary sorting function.
